# CDP_Graph

This takes in a CDP Crawl file and will out a graph as a png file.
Makes sure that all the hostnames in the CDP Crawl have the domain names removed. 
Also makes sure that hostnames for the same device match up with themself and examples of this is:
switch-1.domain.com and switch-1, same switch but the one has a domain name attached. Make sure to fix this.
